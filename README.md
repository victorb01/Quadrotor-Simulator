# Quadrotor-Simulator
Projects 1-3 coded as part of the Aerial Robotics course at University of Texas at Austin.

These projects were aimed at:
  1) creating a physics simulator for a quadrotor drone
  2) refining the simulator and implementing PD controllers for attitude and position
  3) simulating measurement error and state estimation
